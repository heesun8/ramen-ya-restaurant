# Ramen-Ya Restaurant 

Wanted to make a website for one my favorite meals. (Do people who don't like Ramen exist? If it's you reading write now, forgive me) 
Frontend Restaurant website with Headers, Footers, variations of menus and 'order' buttons and Newsletter features.

### Link to project: https://ramen-ya-restaurant-21t1.vercel.app/

## Tech Used:
Purely React and React icons organized into easily identifiable folder structures. Heavily CSS based project. 
Each component has its own css folder while also having global App.css and index.css files to target overall features. 

**npm start**

A fan of TailwindCSS(please don't strangle me) but for a website as UI heavy as this, in order to have a more personalized look, the classical CSS made sense to me.
